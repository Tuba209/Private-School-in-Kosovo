        <h2><u>About G-Class</u></h2>
        <p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, sometimes colloquially called the G-Wagen (as an abbreviation of Geländewagen) is a four-wheel drive automobile manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz.
            Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line.
             In certain markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.
           The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction.
            It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature.
           Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest-produced vehicles in Daimler's history, with a span of 43 years.
            Only the Unimog surpasses it. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz launched a technically new second generation, still with only minor design changes.

           The 400,000th unit was built on 4 December 2020.</p>

    <h2><u>About Maybach</u></h2>
<p>Maybach (German: [ˈmaɪbax], MY-bokh) is a German luxury car brand that exists today as a part of Mercedes-Benz.
     The original company was founded in 1909 by Wilhelm Maybach and his son Karl Maybach,
      originally as a subsidiary of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH, and it was known as Luftfahrzeug-Motorenbau GmbH until 1999.
      In 1960, Maybach was acquired by Daimler-Benz.
     The name returned as a standalone ultra-luxury car brand in 2002, sharing significant components with Mercedes-Benz cars.
      After slow sales, Maybach ceased to be a standalone brand by 2013,
       and it became (in 2015) a sub-brand of Mercedes-Benz,which is owned by the Mercedes-Benz Group.
     As of 2021, Daimler produces an ultra-luxury edition of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class under the Mercedes-Maybach name.</p>

<h2>About C-Class </h2>
<p>The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a series of compact executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz Group AG.
    Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190 (W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest model in the marque's line-up until the W168 A-Class arrived in 1997.
    The C-Class has been available with a "4MATIC" four-wheel drive option since 2002.
    The third generation (W204) was launched in 2007 while the current W206 generation was launched in 2021.
    Initially available in sedan and a station wagon configurations, a fastback coupé (SportCoupé) variant followed and was later renamed to Mercedes-Benz CLC-Class.
    It remained in production until 2011 when a new W204 C-Class coupé replaced it for the 2012 model year.</p>
