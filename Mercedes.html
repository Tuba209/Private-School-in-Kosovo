<h2><u>The history of Mercedes</u></h2>
<p>Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's creation of the first gasoline-powered car,
     the Benz Patent Motorwagen, patented in January 1886 and Gottlieb Daimler and engineer Wilhelm Maybach,
      who converted a wagon by adding a gasoline engine.
       The first Mercedes car was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft.
        The first Mercedes-Benz cars were produced in 1926, with the merger of the companies of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler to create the Daimler-Benz company.
         Throughout the 1930s, Mercedes-Benz produced the 770, a very popular car during the German Reich.
          Nazis Adolf Hitler is known to have driven many such cars during his time in power, with bulletproof windows.
           Most of the surviving models have been sold at auction to private buyers.
            One of them is on display at the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario.
             Mercedes-Benz has invented many technical and safety innovations which later became common in other brands.
     Mercedes-Benz is one of the most well-known car brands in the world, and is the oldest car brand in the</p>

     <h2><u>About G-Class</u></h2>
     <p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, sometimes colloquially called the G-Wagen (as an abbreviation of Geländewagen) is a four-wheel drive automobile manufactured by Magna Steyr (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria and sold by Mercedes-Benz.
         Originally developed as a military off-roader, later more luxurious models were added to the line.
          In certain markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.
        The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and body-on-frame construction.
         It uses three fully locking differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to have such a feature.
        Despite the introduction of an intended replacement, the unibody SUV Mercedes-Benz GL-Class in 2006, the G-Class is still in production and is one of the longest-produced vehicles in Daimler's history, with a span of 43 years.
         Only the Unimog surpasses it. In 2018, Mercedes-Benz launched a technically new second generation, still with only minor design changes.
        Puch G
        The 400,000th unit was built on 4 December 2020.</p>

    <h2><u>About Maybach</u></h2>
<p>Maybach (German: [ˈmaɪbax], MY-bokh) is a German luxury car brand that exists today as a part of Mercedes-Benz.
     The original company was founded in 1909 by Wilhelm Maybach and his son Karl Maybach,
      originally as a subsidiary of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH, and it was known as Luftfahrzeug-Motorenbau GmbH until 1999.
      In 1960, Maybach was acquired by Daimler-Benz.
     The name returned as a standalone ultra-luxury car brand in 2002, sharing significant components with Mercedes-Benz cars.
      After slow sales, Maybach ceased to be a standalone brand by 2013,
       and it became (in 2015) a sub-brand of Mercedes-Benz,which is owned by the Mercedes-Benz Group.
     As of 2021, Daimler produces an ultra-luxury edition of the Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Mercedes-Benz GLS-Class under the Mercedes-Maybach name.</p>
