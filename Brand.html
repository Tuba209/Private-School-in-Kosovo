    <h2>About G-Class 2023</h2>
    <p>Now in its fifth year of production the Mercedes-Benz G-Class continues to blast through sales goals despite raises in price.
         After a year of closed order banks in the United States following heavy demand and supply shortages the G-Wagon is again available to order for those stateside.
          The G-Class returns with an even higher base MSRP, new colors, and new special addition trims.
           Competition is not in the G-Class's territory, as the massive SUV is in a styling class of its own.
         Even the V8 Land Rover Defender falls short in exuding the same amount of luxury and ruggedness that comes effortlessly with the Mercedes-Benz G-Class</p>

        <h2>About C-Class 2023</h2>
        <p>Like many a carmaker these days, Mercedes-Benz is largely pursuing a strategy of offering the same flavor of automobile in different sizes.
             The new all-electric EQE and EQS look almost identical, and you can bet their future SUV siblings will as well; the GT and GT 4-Door could be confused for one another from the front if you didn't have them side-by-side for reference.
              It's even present in their naming strategy; there's a reason Mercedes rebranded the GLK-, ML- and GL-Class SUVs as GLC, GLE and GLS, and it ain't because their badge supplier was offering a deal on the letters G and L.
            But there's precedent for this move at Mercedes â€” and it's the C-Class. Even more than the E-Class, which often has a bit of its own distinct design flavor (remember the quad-headlight era of the 1990s?), the compact C has long been a shrunken-down version of the range-topping S-Class in looks and vibe.
            So, with an all-new C-Class hitting the streets this spring for the 2023 model year, we took it for a spin in upstate New York to see if it still manages to serve up S-Class vibes at a Ford Mustang GT price.</p>

            <h2>About Maybach 2023</h2>
            <p>
                The current generation of Mercedes-Benz Maybach S-Class was introduced in 2021 alongside the standard seventh-generation S-Class. It combines the cutting-edge tech features of Mercedes' newest flagship with handcrafted luxury touches that elevate it to another level of premium. For 2023, changes to the Maybach are minor.
                 There's a new Manufaktur line of exclusive paint and exterior trim colors and two limited-production special editions: the Haute Voiture and S 680 by Virgil Abloh.
                The Maybach offers two engine choices, including a 496-horsepower twin-turbocharged V8 and a 621-hp twin-turbo V12.
                 They're considered different trim levels, but each offers the same generous list of standard features.
                  The Mercedes-Benz Maybach comes truly loaded, with features like a massive 12.8-inch digital instrument panel, a 12.3-inch OLED touchscreen infotainment system, a full-color head-up display, massaging front seats, rear neck heaters and a 30-speaker audio system all included.
                   Mercedes has traditionally used the S-Class to show off its latest and greatest features, and the 2023 Maybach showcases the very best the three-pointed star brand has to offer.
                 The Maybach is one of only a handful of cars competing in the ultra-luxe full-size sedan class.
                  Its two top rivals are the Bentley Flying Spur and Rolls-Royce Ghost, but you might also cross-shop it with a high-dollar spec of the regular S-Class.
                   They'll drive similarly, but the Maybach offers an air of exclusivity that must be experienced to be fully understood</p>
